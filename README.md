# Warehouse-layout
 Web Application development written in PHP/Laravel (in transition from <a href="https://github.com/Tarnvedra/Warehouse-origin">(Origin - PHP/HTML5)</a>) for efficient product selection, using web app for efficient placement of stock using layout planning and with volumetrics (calculations using Mass , Volume and Density)

 # Abstract
Stock Management and its efficient movement is one of the biggest challenges facing a distribution warehouse. Bottlenecks in this process cost the business time and money. For this application a small section of a warehouse is investigated, in particular the picking department to try to improve on the current process and to maximise efficiency using an Information Technology solution. The technology in question is a web application, which uses intelligent space planning to ascertain a products optimal location based on its mass and volume rather than its secondary packaging and general
size of a product to assist in streamlining the picking process.




# Problem Description / Key Aims

**Key Issues:**

In Stock storage, Warehousing and distribution the Incorrect placement or location of product not only results in poor Stock management but also leads to a reduction in the output and efficiency of Operator productivity (pick rate %). These combined inefficiencies all have a negative effect on both the performance and profitability of a Business.

One of the key factors is inefficient space planning. This leads to the incorrect positioning of stock into unsuitable locations, products that are positioned based only on the weight/size of its secondary packaging i.e. Outer packing case and not by its relative size/weight ratio and primary packaging i.e. Inner packaging/Wrapping. 

As a consequence of poor space planning, Operators on many occasions are unable to pick and fit all items on their Pick list into one Roll Cage, when in reality more items that are smaller/lighter in size could also be picked and added to the cage. This leads to additional roll-cages being used all of which have to be re-sorted and condensed down prior to despatch and loading onto vehicles.

This then creates repeat handling and an increased workload on despatch Operators which ultimately slows down the total end to end process.

**Key Aims:**

* Eliminate waste by maximising the use of total storage space by the introduction of intelligent space planning.

* Improving the efficiency and productivity of Operators with logical and accurate Pick lists.

* Eliminate waste from double handling of stock/Roll cages prior to loading/despatch.

* Improve and encourage greater job satisfaction and job enrichment for Operators

* Increase Output and profitability of the Business
