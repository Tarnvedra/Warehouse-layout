# Warehouse-layout
 Web Application development written in PHP/Laravel (in transition from <a href="https://github.com/Tarnvedra/Warehouse-origin">(Origin - PHP/HTML5)</a>) for efficient product selection, using web app for efficient placement of stock using layout planning and with volumetrics (calculations using Mass , Volume and Density)

 # Abstract
Stock Management and its efficient movement is one of the biggest challenges facing a distribution warehouse. Bottlenecks in this process cost the business time and money. For this application a small section of a warehouse is investigated, in particular the picking department to try to improve on the current process and to maximise efficiency using an Information Technology solution. The technology in question is a web application, which uses intelligent space planning to ascertain a products optimal location based on its mass and volume rather than its secondary packaging and general
size of a product to assist in streamlining the picking process.
